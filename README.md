# CoSketch

**CoSketch** is a real-time collaborative whiteboard and code editor platform â€” think Google Docs meets VS Code.  
Itâ€™s built for **brainstorming, teaching, interviewing, and remote teamwork** â€” letting you draw, sketch, and code together in one seamless experience.

## ðŸŒŸ Why CoSketch?

In a world of remote work and online learning, collaboration tools are essential.  
Most tools either focus on **visual brainstorming** (whiteboards) or **code collaboration** â€” but rarely both in one platform.  
CoSketch combines them, so your team can:

- **Visualize ideas** with a shared whiteboard  
- **Write & review code** together in real time  
- **Chat & coordinate** without switching apps

## âœ¨ Key Features

- ðŸ–Œ **Real-time Whiteboard**  
  Draw shapes, lines, or freehand sketches, and watch them instantly appear on everyoneâ€™s screen.

- ðŸ’» **Collaborative Code Editing**  
  Live code editing with syntax highlighting for multiple languages.  
  (Powered by Monaco Editor or CodeMirror with CRDT-based sync)

- âš¡ **Instant Sync**  
  CRDTs (via Yjs) and WebSockets ensure every keystroke, drawing, and message is synchronized.

- ðŸ‘¥ **Multi-User Rooms**  
  Share a unique link and collaborate instantly â€” no setup needed.

- ðŸ”’ **Identity & Roles**  
  Optional authentication for persistent identities and role-based permissions.

- ðŸ’¬ **In-App Chat**  
  Keep discussions inside the session without jumping between tools.

## ðŸ–¼ How It Works

1. **Create or Join a Room**  
   Every session has a unique room ID, which participants can join via a link.

2. **Draw & Code in Real Time**  
   Whiteboard actions and code edits are transmitted instantly via WebSockets and Yjs.

3. **Seamless State Sharing**  
   Whether someone joins at the start or mid-session, they see the **exact** current state.

4. **Persistent Data** *(optional)*  
   Save session history, whiteboard drawings, and code snippets to MongoDB for future reference.
